# RegenerativeFarming
This is a stardew valley mod that adds soil health metrics to the game.  Different crops cause different effects on the soil, some are regenerative, others destructive. The potential revenue of each crop is changed to reflect the difficulty of growing them.

This mod is compatible with Cornucopia and Ridgeside Village.  For more details, see the links below!
